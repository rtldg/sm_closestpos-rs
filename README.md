you'll need to clone my sm-ext-rs repo that has some stuff used in this https://github.com/rtldg/sm-ext-rs

also this isn't finished as kiddo is slower than nanoflann which i used in the C++ version of sm_closestpos

posting this for backup and maybe i'll make a faster or somehow improved 3d pos closest pos lookup library
